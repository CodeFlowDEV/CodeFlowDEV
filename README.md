### 👋 Welcome
Welcome to the GitHub home of **CodeFlow**. While my premium work focuses on complex **Military, PvP, and Hardcore Survival** systems, I believe every server needs a solid foundation.

Here, you will find my **"Standard Issue"** collection—free, lightweight, and optimized scripts to improve your server's quality of life.

### 💣 Premium Armory (Tebex)
*Looking for the heavy hitters?*
My store offers advanced systems protected by CFX Escrow, with affordable pricing to avoid the "overpriced script" trend.

> Scripts i focus on
* **🪖 Military**
* **🏹 Survival**
* **⚔️ PVP**

---

> *"We offer a promising price, but our open source scripts are a bit higher to avoid code leaking."*
